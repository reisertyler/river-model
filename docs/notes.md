## River model
Social insects ... moving in a direction with no sense of rules...

#### Problems to Think About
1. How do you know when you are close?
    - i.e. who are the neighbors?
    - number of neighbors
    - so, the location of each point depends on the neighbor

2. What direction am I moving?

3. What rate am I moving out?
4. Width of river
    - when the rivers interact with eachother the widths becoming

5. Who are my new neighbors?
    - one circle will "eclipse" another
    - think of a grid, how many points of river are flowing over?
        - if there are two, what does that mean?
        - i.e. 

- every point will move radial outward based on the normal


#### Important Attributes
For any point,

1.
2.
3.

#### 1. Breaking through

- how do you know if they crossed?
- Who get's removed from the list? 

two bends some closer and closer. How do you reroute the river?
